1. Install the latest NodeJs
2. Install postgresql, create a new user (name: OCmanager; password: OCmanagerPASS)
2. Clone the app
3. Run `npm i` inside the folder
4. Run `node server.js`
5. Surf to http://YOURIP:8000/signup to create a student role: Name: Student1; Role: student
5. Surf to http://YOURIP:8000/signup to create a teacher role: Name: Teacher1; Role: teacher
